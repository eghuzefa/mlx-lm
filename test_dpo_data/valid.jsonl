{"prompt": "What is gravity?", "chosen": "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes objects with mass to attract each other. Einstein's theory of general relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. On Earth, gravity pulls objects toward the center at approximately 9.8 m/sÂ², giving objects weight and keeping us grounded.", "rejected": "Gravity pulls things down."}
{"prompt": "How do birds fly?", "chosen": "Birds fly through a combination of wing shape, muscle power, and physics. Their wings are curved on top and flatter below, creating lift as air moves faster over the top surface. Strong flight muscles power the wing beats, while hollow bones keep them lightweight. Tail feathers provide steering and stability, and specialized respiratory systems supply the oxygen needed for sustained flight.", "rejected": "Birds flap their wings to stay in the air."}
